Hello, this is a sample cybersecurity project that I have created. This program, when executed at the command prompt will make a log of everything that is typed on the keyboard, including buttons that are pressed and also things typed on the internet or on documents.

This keylogger will create a keylogger.txt file that captures all the keystrokes.

You can also send it to your email by modifying the username and password fields. In order to run this iteration of the keylogger you have to call upon it by running the command python keylogger.py. 

In order to exit out of the programming hit the 'esc key', this will stop the program from recording keystrokes.

Live keylogger action:
